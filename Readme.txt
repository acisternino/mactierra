This is a Macintosh implementation of Tom Ray's Tierra: <http://life.ou.edu/tierra/>

It's an independent implementation by Simon Fraser <smfr at smfr . org>, who write a Mac OS Classic version many moons ago: <http://www.smfr.org/work/sfi/mactierra/>

This is a Mac OS X rewrite, with a platform-neutral engine, and a Cocoa front-end.

Please send bugs and feedback to Simon Fraser <smfr at smfr . org>

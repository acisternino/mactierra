Engine
------

Optimize template searching
Improve genotype tracking; treat a creature's "real" genotype as the genotype at birth.

Limit range of instruction pointer from creature (enforce locality of reference)

Cocoa front-end
---------------

Fix thread-safety issues when using data from the collectors.
Add more types of data collection
Add ability to edit RNG state in the middle of a run (so you can "fork" a run)
Improve drag feedback.
Improve soup display
    scaling
    smarter aspect ratio for different sizes
Implement tracking of a lineage
Make inventory more useful (keep "successful" genotypes in the list)
Highlight creatures when selected in inventory
Add ability to control update rate.

GraphX:
    Optimize line graph drawing (split drawing/data fetching, cache the bezier)
    Fix x-axis labels for time-based graphs
    Add ability to draw more than one data set

Refactor data logging classes, saved logged data with the soup.

Genebank:
    Store soup config with creatures (since creature success may depend on soup features)
    Figure out how to name genebank genotypes
    Make the code cross-platform?


Command-line tool
-----------------

Needs basic work.
Hook up more commandline args
Add ability to save the soup every N instructions
